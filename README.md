The drainage system is part of the Hydroponic project, is to enable developers to control the Raspberrypi
the GPIO ports remotely without connect screen or keyboard. 

There a CLI (command line interface), so you can issue commands directly to it over SSH scripting.

For those interested in the technical details its mostly written in PHP, JS and Python which runs the back end for both the command line and the web browser interface (which is served with Apache). 
the emailing is done with msmtp and the network can be managed 
by Raspians wpagui.
